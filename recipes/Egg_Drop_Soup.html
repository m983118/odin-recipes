    <h1>Egg Fried Rice</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is as good as the restaurant's soup. Everyone in the family enjoyed this, which is very unusual. My pickiest eater even ate this soup, after fishing out the chives. She thought the egg was noodles, and to get through dinner without a complaint, we didn't tell her differently. Thank you for an easy yet wonderful recipe. (Not to mention a dinner without complaints!) :)<p>
    <p>This recipe was awesome! Thanks so much! A KEEPER! My husband LOVES egg drop soup and this is superior to the others I tried. Big tip: I used the low sodium chicken broth to keep the salty taste other egg drop soups get down. I make often since it so easy-and a family favorite. If I don't have chicken broth on hand, I use 1 cup of water to 1 crushed chicken cube per serving as desired. Thanks so much!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth, divided</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Reserve 3/4 cup of chicken broth, and pour the rest into a large saucepan. Stir the salt, ginger and chives into the saucepan, and bring to a rolling boil. In a cup or small bowl, stir together the remaining broth and cornstarch until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and egg yolk together using a fork. Drizzle egg a little at a time from the fork into the boiling broth mixture. Egg should cook immediately. Once the eggs have been dropped, stir in the cornstarch mixture gradually until the soup is the desired consistency.</li>
    </ol>
